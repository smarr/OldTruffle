Truffle is a framework for writing and executing interpreters. In case
you want to execute already written interpreters from your Java application,
start at {@link com.oracle.truffle.api.vm.PolyglotEngine}. In case you'd like
to write your own Truffle based language, start at 
{@link com.oracle.truffle.api.TruffleLanguage}.
<p>
To get the best speed out of your Truffle system, make sure you are running
on top of 
<a target="_blank" href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/graal/">Graal</a>
virtual machine.
<p>
Our typicial sample language is called the <em>SimpleLanguage</em>.
A good entry point for exploring <em>SimpleLanguage</em> is the
